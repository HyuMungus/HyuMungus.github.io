      Ever since I was a child, I had access to a computer and as a result I was fascinated with how everything works in the digital world. Everything from websites, games, applications, etc.. I always had a desire to learn how to create such things so I pursued it starting from a young age. I studied everything on how to be a software engineer with programs such as Thinkful, courses that I took in university, and ones that I took in highschool. As a software engineer I hope to be able to create something that can change the world and I'm always looking for opportunities to work with a team of dedicated developers. If you're interested in reaching out to me please feel free to do so via my contacts.
